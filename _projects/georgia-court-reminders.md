SMS reminder system helping DeKalb County residents remember their court dates. Missing a court hearing can trigger fines, warrants, and jail time—consequences that disproportionately affect low-income communities. This project sends automated text reminders to help break that cycle.

## Impact

- Reduces failure-to-appear rates in DeKalb County
- Helps prevent cascading consequences (fines, warrants, incarceration)
- Built on proven courtbot model used by brigades nationwide

## Get Involved

This project is actively recruiting contributors! We need help with:

- Python development
- Cloud infrastructure (Google Cloud)
- SMS/Twilio integration
- Court data scraping and processing
