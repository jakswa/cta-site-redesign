A tool that auto-generates interactive Leaflet maps from Google Docs spreadsheets. Designed to make mapping accessible to non-technical users—just fill in a spreadsheet and get a shareable map.

## How It Works

1. Create a Google Spreadsheet with location data
2. Publish the spreadsheet to the web
3. Maps For Us generates an interactive map automatically

## Use Cases

- Community asset mapping
- Event locations
- Resource directories
- Any data with addresses or coordinates
