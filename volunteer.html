        <h3>What to Expect</h3>
        <p>Hack nights happen on the <strong>2nd and 4th Mondays</strong> of each month. A typical evening looks like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Arrive</strong> - Doors open, grab food, mingle</li>
          <li><strong>Kickoff</strong> - Announcements and project updates</li>
          <li><strong>Hack time</strong> - Break into project groups and work</li>
          <li><strong>Wrap up</strong> - Share progress and wins</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Check <a href="{{ site.meetup_url }}">Meetup</a> for exact times. Don't worry about coming "prepared" - just show up! We welcome all skill levels and backgrounds.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="guide-section">
        <h3>How to Pick a Project</h3>
        <p>After announcements, project leads give quick pitches about what they're working on. You can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Join an existing project that sounds interesting</li>
          <li>Float between projects to learn about each one</li>
          <li>Help with general tasks (documentation, research, outreach)</li>
          <li>Propose your own project idea</li>
        </ul>
