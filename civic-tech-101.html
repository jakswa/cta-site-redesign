      <h2>What is Civic Tech?</h2>
      <p>Civic technology is technology that enables greater participation in government or otherwise assists government in delivering services to citizens. It's about using digital tools to improve how communities and government work together.</p>

      <p>Civic tech can take many forms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Open Data</strong> - Making government data accessible and usable by the public</li>
        <li><strong>Civic Engagement</strong> - Tools that help people participate in democracy</li>
        <li><strong>Government Services</strong> - Improving how people interact with government</li>
        <li><strong>Community Tools</strong> - Apps and services that help neighbors help each other</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Does It Matter?</h2>
      <p>Technology shapes how we live, work, and interact with each other. When civic institutions don't keep pace with technological change, it creates barriers - especially for the most vulnerable members of our communities.</p>

      <p>Civic tech matters because:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Everyone deserves easy access to public services</li>
        <li>Transparency builds trust between government and citizens</li>
        <li>Technology should serve the public good, not just private interests</li>
        <li>Communities have valuable expertise that technology can amplify</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Get Involved</h2>
      <p>You don't need to be a technologist to participate in civic tech. We need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designers who understand user needs</li>
        <li>Writers who can make complex topics accessible</li>
        <li>Researchers who can gather community input</li>
        <li>Subject matter experts from government, nonprofits, and community organizations</li>
        <li>Anyone who cares about their community</li>
      </ul>
