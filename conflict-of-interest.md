This policy protects Civic Tech Atlanta against transactions that might improperly benefit officers, directors, or committee members while maintaining our organizational integrity.

## Definitions

**Interested Person:** Directors, principal officers, or committee members with governing authority who have direct or indirect financial interests.

**Financial Interest:** Includes ownership stakes, investment interests, compensation arrangements, or potential future interests in entities with which the organization transacts. Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that are not insubstantial.

## Procedures

### Disclosure Requirements

Interested parties must disclose financial interests and material facts to decision-makers. When uncertain, individuals should disclose and allow peers to determine if a conflict exists.

### Conflict Determination

After disclosure and discussion, the interested person must leave during deliberations. Remaining members vote on whether a conflict exists.

### Transaction Review

The board may appoint disinterested parties to investigate alternatives. They must determine if better arrangements exist without conflicts. If not, a majority of disinterested members votes on whether proceeding serves the organization's interests fairly.

### Violations

The board investigates undisclosed conflicts and may take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.

## Additional Safeguards

- Board members receiving compensation cannot vote on their own compensation matters
- Annual attestations required confirming policy receipt and understanding
- Periodic reviews assess compensation reasonableness and partnership arrangements
- Outside advisors may assist but do not relieve board responsibility
