      <h2>Our Process</h2>
      <p>We've developed a lightweight process to ensure projects are a good fit and set up for success:</p>

      <ol class="process-steps">
        <li>
          <strong>Submit a Proposal</strong><br>
          Tell us about your organization and the challenge you're facing. Don't worry if you don't have all the answers - we can help you figure things out.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Initial Review</strong><br>
          We review proposals for alignment with our mission and capacity. We'll reach out with questions or to schedule a conversation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Discovery</strong><br>
          We'll dig deeper into stakeholder needs, accessibility requirements, and sustainability planning to make sure we build the right thing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Project Planning</strong><br>
          Together we'll develop an initial high-level project plan with clear goals, milestones, and success metrics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Build Together</strong><br>
          We present the project to our community at hack nights to recruit volunteers. You'll work alongside us as a partner, not just a client.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> As part of our process, we ask project leads to complete worksheets on Impact Measurement, Racial Equity & Accessibility, and Resourcing & Feasibility. If you don't have all the answers, that's ok! We can help you work through them.</p>
